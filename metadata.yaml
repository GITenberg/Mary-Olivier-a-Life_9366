description: '"As a child, Mary Olivier''s dreamy disposition and fierce intelligence
  set her apart from her Victorian family, especially her mother, "Little Mamma,"
  whose dazzling looks cannot hide her meager love for her only daughter. Mary grows
  up in a world of her own, a solitude that leaves her free to explore her deepest
  passions, for literature and philosophy, for the austere beauties of England''s
  north country, even as she continues to attend to her family. But in time the independence
  Mary values at almost any cost threatens to become a form of captivity itself"--Publisher''s
  description.'
